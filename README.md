**I had built an automation project on Farming using IoT in a recent hackathon I had participated in. I was Team Lead of a team of 5 and we built a comprehensive full-stack Web/AI-ML/IoT project consisting of farming analytics, locust prevention, crop disease prediction, integrated MQTT communication, crop mineral content and freshness monitoring system, smart irrigation system along with fertilizer recommender system.**
<br />
**My role was to develop the Node.js Backend along with the MongoDB database, the entire Frontend of the website, implementing the MQTT protocol and also handling the IoT part with one of my other teammates (detecting Soil-Moisture through sensors and sending the data generated to my Node.js Backend and also starting an autonomous Irrigation Pump at lower moisture levels, sending notifications to the user dashboard and via SMS, integrating the web backend part with the ML models via Flask).
The trickiest part was sending the sensor data acquired by our IoT setup to the ML models via our Node.js server and getting the ML model prediction.**
